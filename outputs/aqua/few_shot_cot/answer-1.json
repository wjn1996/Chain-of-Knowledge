The angle of elevation changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0, so the change in height is 60\u00b0 - 45\u00b0 = 15\u00b0. Since the angle of elevation is changing at a uniform rate, the time it takes for the angle of elevation to change by 1\u00b0 is 10 minutes. So the time it takes for the angle of elevation to change by 15\u00b0 is 15 * 10 minutes = 150 minutes. Therefore, it will take 150 minutes more for the car to reach the base of the tower. \n\nSo the answer is (E)."}
